# MCMC_decoder
This project implements a text decoder based on the MCMC algorithm (Markov Chain Monte Carlo). 

The goal is to decrypt data that has previously been encrypted using a substitution cipher. It is assumed that the encryption key is unknown and it is necessary to decrypt the data and read the code using the recovered decryption key.
